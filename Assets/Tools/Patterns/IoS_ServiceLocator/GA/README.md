IoC - Your classes donâ€™t create their own dependencies. They get them from the outside.

Soooo it's just to register some global and scene services like localization etc? Something that's singular for that scale

And I can register services that's on some `GameObject`? And it will go to the same scale

IoS can be done with both Dependency Injection and Service Locator

Inverting dependencies
Problem:
1. Tightly coupled to a specific implementation of a type
2. Can't exposed made instance without making it public

It acts as a central repository for all the references of things we are going to need access to - SO THIS IS WHY IT'S GOOD FOR MEDIATOR AND UI?????
So we don't have to start linking all our game objects together
It allows us to get references with registering services:
- On GameObject lvl
- On Scene lvl
- On Global lvl

Register in Awake, use at Start and later

ServiceManager - storage and retrieval of different services
Bootstraper does configuration when we want a locator of a different type
